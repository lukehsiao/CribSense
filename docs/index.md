# CribSense Overview

CribSense is an video-based, contactless baby monitor that you can make yourself without breaking the bank.

CribSense is a C++ implementation of [Video Magnification](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/) tuned to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Over a weekend, you can setup your own crib-side baby monitor that raises an alarm if your infant stops moving. As a bonus all of the software is open source and easily extensible.

## Getting Started
CribSense is made up of two parts: the baby monitoring software and some simple hardware. Find out all you need to know about how to use and recreate your own monitor in the sections below.
